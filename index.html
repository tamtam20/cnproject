    <h1>Butterfly World</h1>
    <h2>Butterflies are highly sensitive indicators of the health of the environment and play crucial roles in the food chain as well as being pollinators of plants.</h2>
    <p>- The UK has 60 species of butterflies - 57 resident species of butterflies and two regular migrants – the Painted Lady and Clouded Yellow.</p>
    <p>- Five species of butterfly have become extinct in the last 150 years. These are the Mazarine Blue, Large Tortoiseshell, Black-veined White, Large Copper and Large Blue.</p>
    <p>- The State of the UK’s Butterflies 2015 report found that 76% of the UK’s resident and regular migrant butterflies declined in abundance, occurrence or both over the last four decades.</p>
    <p>Butterfly eggs are almost invariably laid on plants. Each species of butterfly has its own host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family.</p>
